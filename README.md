# Final-Year-Project
## Reduction of Personal Carbon Emissions Through Gamification

The aim of this project was to develop an app for the Apple iOS operating system that would achieve the goal of reducing an individual’s carbon emissions through gamification. The idea behind the project was to create an application that would help individuals understand their impact on carbon emissions and to help them realise how they as an individual can contribute to stopping global warming, instead of leaving it to governments and corporations. This project encompasses the research of what a carbon footprint is and how it is calculated, the research into the effectiveness of gamification and what gamification techniques exist, and the research of existing solutions. The project describes the finished application and its implementation, the features that were implemented and how they work, and the basics of the Swift programming language and the SwiftUI user interface framework. Implementing the solution entailed the learning of iOS development using the Swift programming language, the utilisation of various frameworks, tools and services. The project also included beta testing and a user survey of the app to find the areas in which the app is lacking.

## Brief App Overview
This is an iOS app that aims to reduce the user’s personal carbon emissions through gamification. Using the app, the user can calculate their carbon footprint and view which areas of their day-to-day life contribute to their carbon footprint the most. Furthermore, the user can view a leaderboard of the lowest carbon emitters to understand how their own carbon footprint compares to the carbon footprint of other users of the app. Another feature of the app is the avoided emissions tracker, where the user can track actions that result in fewer carbon emissions. Lessons and quizzes provide an interactive and engaging way of learning how an individual can reduce their carbon footprint. While awards acknowledge the user’s progress.
